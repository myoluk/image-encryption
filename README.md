## About

- Encrypts and decrypts images with custom algorithm

- Images can encrypt with a key or with a default key

- Images can be RGB, grayscale etc.

## Modes
There are 2 modes available **easy/fast** mode (default) and **hard/slow** mode

- **Easy/fast** mode uses `lockBits` and `unlockBits`
- **Hard/slow** mode uses `getPixel` and `setPixel`

üëâ _Choose **hard/slow** mode for more complex encryption algorithm_
